## Installation

You can't install this project, but if you could, you would use ```npm install```. I guess.


## Usage

Don't use this project. Plain and simple — what's more to like?


## License

This project is covered under the Apache 2.0 License — see the [Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) for details.


## Contributing

You can't contribute to this project. It's not real. Even if you could, I wouldn't want you to.


## Tests

Do you really need to test something that's already perfect? Well, I guess you could run ```npm test```, but it's going to give you an error. There aren't any tests to run.
